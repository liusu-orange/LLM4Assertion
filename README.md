# Verilog Assertion Training and Inference

This project is designed for training and inference using Verilog code assertion pairs. It includes scripts for fine-tuning models and a local server for deployment.

## Installation

Install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip --default-timeout=1000 install "unsloth[121]" -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
pip install trl transformers accelerate peft bitsandbytes
pip install tf-keras
pip install pandas openpyxl
pip install nltk rouge
pip install scikit-learn
pip install wandb
pip install uvicorn
pip install fastapi

Dataset
The dataset (vert.xlsx) contains 20,000 Verilog code assertion pairs.

Usage
Training and Inference
Run the following script to start training and inference:
python sft.py

Local Server
Start the local server with the following command:
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Frontend
The frontend code is located in the template directory (index.html).
